            <p>
                Thanks for testing out the mask model gatekeeper app! My hope is to eventually integrate this into a
                react-native module!

                Some notes about data sourcing:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The real masked dataset was created by a Chinese institution and included mostly Asian people. As a
                    result, Asian faces may be a bias factor. Artificially generated masked data did not include this
                    bias

                </li>
                <li>
                    Head positioning was a concern, as direct facing was more common than profile or other views. This
                    was addressed by adding a dataset of various head angles. However, various head angles with masks
                    was not achievable.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Mask patterns also present a problem. In many of the mask images only a single type of mask is used
                    (medical). This can confuse the model when predicting on patterned masks.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Improper Mask Data sourcing proved to be very challenging. Originally it appeared the Mask-Face-Net
                    data source would have a good source for artificially created improper mask wearing, but ultimately
                    the distortions were not helpful and often rightfully confused with proper mask wearing.
